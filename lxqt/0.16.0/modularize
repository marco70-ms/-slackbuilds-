# If a package is listed here, it will be built apart from the
# usual "grab bag" package that's made from each source directory.
#
# Things to note:
#
# Listing a package here will not cause it to be built.  To do that,
# make sure it is added to one of the files in the modules/ directory
# that is built by the main lxqt.SlackBuild script.
#
# If a subpackage name happens to be the same as the "grab bag" package
# that contains it, you need to be a bit careful.  Unless everything
# in that collection will be built modular, *do not* list that name
# here!  If you do, first the module by that name will be built, and
# then everything that's not modular in that collection will be built
# into a "grab bag" that will replace that first package.
#
# If the goal is to build the most combined packages possible, the
# easiest way to accomplish that is just to move this file out of the
# way and replace it with an empty one before building.
